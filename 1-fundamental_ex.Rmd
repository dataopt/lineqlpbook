1.  Determine the optimal value of the following linear programming problem:
    \[
    \begin{array}{rl}
    \min & x \\
    \text{s.t.}
    & x + y  \geq 2 \\
    & x - 2y + z \geq 0 \\
    &   y - 2z \geq -1.
    \end{array}
    \]

2.  Determine if the following linear programming problem has an optimal 
    solution:
    \[
    \begin{array}{rl}
    \min & x_1 + 2x_2 \\
    \text{s.t.}
    & x_1 + 3x_2  \geq 4 \\
    & -x_1 + x_2  \geq 0.
    \end{array}
    \]

3. A set \(S \subset \RR^n\) is said to be bounded if there exists a real
   number \(M \gt 0\) such that for every \(\vec{x} \in S\),
   \(|x_i| \lt M\) for all \(i = 1,\ldots, n\).  Prove that every linear
   programming problem with a bounded nonempty feasible region has an
   optimal solution.
