## Exercises {-}

1. Determine the smallest value of \(\mu\) such that
\(x + y \geq \mu\) can be inferred from the system
\begin{align*}
2x + y & \geq 2 \\
x + 3y & \geq 1 \\
3x + 2y & \geq 6
\end{align*}

2. Show that the inequality \(x + 2y \geq 3\) can be inferred from the system
\begin{align*}
2x + y & \geq 2 \\
x + 5y & \geq 7 \\
-x + y & = 1 \\
\end{align*}
in infinitely many ways.
