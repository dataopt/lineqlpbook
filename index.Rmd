# Preface {-}

This book covers the fundamentals of linear programming through 
studying systems of linear inequalities using only basic facts from
linear algebra.  It is suitable for a crash course on linear programming
that emphasizes theoretical aspects of the subject.
Discussion on practical solution methods such as the simplex method 
and interior point methods, though not present in this book, is planned for 
a future book.

Two excellent references for further study are @Bertsimas:1997
and @Schrijver:1986.
