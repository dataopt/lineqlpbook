## Solutions {-}

1.  Adding the first two inequalities gives \(-x \geq a\).
    Adding \(2\) times the second inequality and the third
    inequality gives \(5x \geq 2\), implying that \(x \geq \frac{2}{5}\).
    Hence, if \(a \gt -\frac{2}{5}\), there is no solution.
    
    
    Note that if \(a \leq -\frac{2}{5}\), then
    \((x,y) = \left (\frac{2}{5}, \frac{4}{5}\right)\) 
    satisfies all the inequalities.
    Hence, the problem is infeasible if and only if \(a \gt -\frac{2}{5}\).


2.  Note that the constraint \(|2x - y| \leq 4\) is equivalent to the
    constraints
    \(2x-y\leq 4\) and \(2x-y \geq -4\) taken together, and
    the constraint \(e^{-3x+y} \geq 1\) is equivalent to \(-3x+y \geq 0\).
    Hence, we can rewrite the problem with linear constraints.
    
    
    Finally, minimizing \(2^x \cdot 4^y\) is the same as
    minimizing \(2^{x + 2y}\), which is equivalent to minimizing
    \(x+2y\).
